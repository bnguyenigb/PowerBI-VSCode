# PowerBI-VSCode
A VSCode extension to manage your PowerBI tenant using the Power BI REST API.

# Installation
Due to a current bug in some of the Azure Extension/VSCode integration, this extension currently has a dependency to the [Azure Account extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.azure-account) `v0.9.11`. If you have installed the latest version of Azure Account extension you need to downgrade temporary to `v0.9.11` and login to Azure.

Once you are logged in with the older version, you can simply open this Power BI extension from the Activity Bar.
